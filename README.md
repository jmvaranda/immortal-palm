[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/olefredrik/foundationpress?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

This is a starter-theme for WordPress based on Foundation 6, the most advanced responsive (mobile-first) framework in the world. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product.

Please fork, copy, modify, delete, share or do whatever you like with this.

All contributions are welcome!

## Requirements

This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v4.x.x  to be installed on your machine. Please be aware that you may encounter problems with the installation if you are using v5.1.0 with all the latest features.

FoundationPress uses [Sass](http://Sass-lang.com/) (CSS with superpowers). In short, Sass is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy.

The Sass is compiled using libsass, which requires the GCC to be installed on your machine. Windows users can install it through [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), and Mac users can install it through the [Xcode Command-line Tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

If you have not worked with a Sass-based workflow before, I would recommend reading [FoundationPress for beginners](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/posts/tutorials/foundationpress-for-beginners), a short blog post that explains what you need to know.

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the repository and install with npm
```bash
$ cd my-wordpress-folder/wp-content/themes/
$ git clone https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress.git
$ cd FoundationPress
$ npm install
```

### 2. While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
$ npm run watch
```

If you want to take advantage of browser-sync (automatic browser refresh when a file is saved), simply open your Gulpfile.js and put your local dev-server address (e.g localhost) in this field ```var URL = '';``` , save the Gulpfile and run
```bash
$ npm run watch
```

### 3. For building all the assets, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Build all assets minified and without sourcemaps:
```bash
$ npm run production
```

### Styles

 * `style.css`: Do not worry about this file. (For some reason) it's required by WordPress. All styling are handled in the Sass files described below

 * `assets/scss/foundation.scss`: Make imports for all your styles here
 * `assets/scss/global/*.scss`: Global settings
 * `assets/scss/components/*.scss`: Buttons etc.
 * `assets/scss/modules/*.scss`: Topbar, footer etc.
 * `assets/scss/templates/*.scss`: Page template spesific styling

Please note that you **must** run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in your terminal for the styles to be copied and concatenated. See the [Gulpfile.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/gulpfile.js) for details

### Scripts

* `assets/javascript/custom`: This is the folder where you put all your custom scripts. Every .js file you put in this directory will be minified and concatenated one single .js file. (This is good for site speed and performance)

Please note that you must run `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in your terminal for the scripts to be copied and concatenated. See [Gulpfile.js](https://github.com/olefredrik/FoundationPress/blob/master/gulpfile.js) for details

### The main styles and scripts generated by the build

Version control on these files are turned off because they are automatically generated as part of the build process.

* `assets/stylesheets/foundation.css`: All Sass files are minified and compiled to this file
* `assets/stylesheets/foundation.css.map`: CSS source maps

* `assets/javascript/vendor`: Vendor scripts are copied from `assets/components/` to this directory. We use this path for enqueing the vendor scripts in WordPress.

### Check For WordPress Coding Standards

Foundation comes with everything you need to run tests that will check your theme for WordPress Coding Standards. To enable this feature you'll need to install PHP Codesniffer, along with the WordPress Coding Standards set of "Sniffs". You'll need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) To install both run the following:
```bash
$ composer create-project wp-coding-standards/wpcs:dev-master --no-dev
```
When prompted to remove existing VCS, answer Yes by typing `Y`.

Once you have installed the packages, you can check your entire theme by running:
```bash
$ npm run phpcs
```

If there are errors that Code Sniffer can fix automatically, run the following command to fix them:
```bash
$ npm run phpcbf
```

Parallax.js
===========

Simple parallax scrolling effect inspired by [Spotify.com](http://spotify.com/) implemented as a jQuery plugin  
[http://pixelcog.com/parallax.js/](http://pixelcog.com/parallax.js/)

## Installation

Download package or install with Bower and include `parallax.min.js` in your document after including jQuery.

```bash
$ bower i --save parallax.js
```

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/parallax.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

### Via data attributes

To easily add a parallax effect behind an element, add `data-parallax="scroll"` to the element you want to use, and specify an image with `data-image-src="/path/to/image.jpg"`.

```html
<div class="parallax-window" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="/path/to/image.jpg"></div>
```

### Via JavaScript

To call the parallax plugin manually, simply select your target element with jQuery and do the following:

```javascript
$('.parallax-window').parallax({imageSrc: '/path/to/image.jpg'});
```

### Notes

What parallax.js will do is create a fixed-position element for each parallax image at the start of the document's body. This mirror element will sit behind the other elements and match the position and dimensions of its target object.

Due to the nature of this implementation, you must ensure that these parallax objects and any layers below them are transparent so that you can see the parallax effect underneath.  Also, if there is no other content in this element, you will need to ensure that it has some fixed dimensions otherwise you won't see anything.

```css
.parallax-window {
	min-height: 400px;
	background: transparent;
}
```

Also, keep in mind that once initialized, the parallax plugin presumes a fixed page layout unless it encounters a `scroll` or `resize` event.  If you have a dynamic page in which another javascript method may alter the DOM, you must manually refresh the parallax effect with the following commands:

```javascript
jQuery(window).trigger('resize').trigger('scroll');
```

### Using inner HTML for complex content

You can use the following syntax to enable complex content for the parallax:

```html
<div class="parallax-window">
  <div class="parallax-slider">
    <span style="position:absolute; top: 400px; left: 400px;">Some Text</span>
	<p>Some other Content</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
Please note, that the div with class "parallax-slider" is essential here.

You then need to initialize it through JS and provide the naturalWidth and naturalHeight options in order to be rendered correctly.

```
$('.parallax-window').parallax({
    naturalWidth: 600,
    naturalHeight: 400
  });
```

This also makes it possible to use responsive images in the slider:

```html
<div class="parallax-window">
  <div class="parallax-slider">
    <img src="/path/to/image.jpg" srcset="/path/to/image-400px.jpg 400w, /path/to/image-800px.jpg 800w, /path/to/image-1200px.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw">
  </div>
</div>
```

## Options

Options can be passed in via data attributes of JavaScript.  For data attributes, append the option name to `data-`, as in `data-image-src=""`.

Note that when specifying these options as html data-attributes, you should convert "camelCased" variable names into "dash-separated" lower-case names (e.g. `zIndex` would be `data-z-index=""`).

			<td>xPos yPos</td>
			<td>center center</td>
			<td rowspan="3">This is analogous to the background-position css property. Specify coordinates as top, bottom, right, left, center, or pixel values (e.g. -10px 0px). The parallax image will be positioned as close to these values as possible while still covering the target element.</td>

		<tr>
			<td>speed</td>
			<td>float</td>
			<td>0.2</td>
			<td>The speed at which the parallax effect runs. 0.0 means the image will appear fixed in place, and 1.0 the image will flow at the same speed as the page content.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>zIndex</td>
			<td>number</td>

			<td>iosFix</td>
			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>true</td>
			<td>iOS devices are incompatable with this plugin. If true, this option will set the parallax image as a static, centered background image whenever it detects an iOS user agent. Disable this if you wish to implement your own graceful degradation.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>androidFix</td>
			<td>boolean</td>

			<td>boolean</td>
			<td>false</td>
			<td>(Experimental) If true, will freeze the parallax effect when "over scrolling" in browsers like Safari to prevent unexpected gaps caused by negative scroll positions.</td>
